# Chaos-game-simulation

# This is the simulation for the chaos game triangle, also called the Sierpinsky Triangle.
# Here, for each iteration, one of the three initial vertices of the triangle is chosen randomly. Each iteration makes the turtle go halfway to that vertex from the seed of the previous iteration.
