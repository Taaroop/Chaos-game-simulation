# Chaos-game-simulation

# This is the simulation for the chaos game triangle, also called the Sierpinski Triangle.
# Here, for each iteration, one of the three initial vertices of the triangle is chosen randomly. Each iteration makes the turtle go halfway to that vertex from the seed of the previous iteration.
# The reason you get such fractal-like triangles is:
# Supposing that the initial seed is somewhere in the triangle (if not, then eventually one of the seeds from the iterations will come inside the triangle, since the seeds are, in chaos theory terminology, ‘attracted’ to the vertices), in each iteration the seed is made to hop halfway to the one of the vertices at random. Although the process is random, this process of being ‘attracted’ to the vertices caused the seed to go from one of the ‘triangles’ to a smaller, similar triangle which is two times smaller than its previous one.
